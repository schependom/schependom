# Goeiendag, bonjour, hello there! 👋

I'm Vincent, a second-year Computer Science student at **KU Leuven**.

Since 2020, I've been active at **Artometis** as a (web) designer & developer, working on:

-   🌐 Web development with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **PHP** to integrate WordPress CMS solutions for clients.
-   🖊️ Graphic design in **Figma** and **Adobe Illustrator**.
-   🚀 Motion design using **Adobe After Effects**.

👨🏼‍🏫 I'm also self-taught in **Flutter** and **Python**, and currently diving into **React** (with Tailwind & TypeScript).

At university, I’ve gained extensive experience with:

-   **LaTeX** (academic writing and presentations)
-   **R** (statistics)
-   **SQL** (databases)
-   **Object-Oriented Programming** (Java)
-   **Declarative languages** (Prolog)
-   **Computer Architecture** (Yes, I can write ASM. No, I don’t enjoy it. 🙈)

### 🚀 Entrepreneurship

In 2024, I founded **Nuuf**, my own company where I focus on **web development, software solutions, and digital design**.

🏃🏽 Running | 🚴🏽‍♂️ Cycling | 🏋🏽 Strength training
