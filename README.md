I'm Vincent, a third-year Computer Science student at **KU Leuven** and self-employed developer & designer.

## Studies

At university, I’ve gained extensive experience with:

-   **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** (NN's in PyTorch)
-   **Machine Learning Operations** (creating a production-level ML codebase)
-   **C-programming** (operating systems, TCP/IP, UNIX environments)
-   **R** (statistics)
-   **SQL** (databases)
-   **Object-Oriented Programming** (Java)
-   **Declarative languages** (Prolog, Haskell, ASP)
-   **Computer Architecture** (Yes, I can write ASM. No, I don’t enjoy it. 🙈)
-   **LaTeX** (academic writing and presentations)

I'm also self-taught in **Flutter** and **Python**, and currently diving into **React** & **NextJS**.

## Entrepreneurship

Since 2020, I've been active at **Artometis** as a (web) designer & developer, working on:

-   Web development with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and **PHP** to integrate WordPress CMS solutions for clients.
-   Graphic & motion design, using the **Adobe Creative Suite** and **Figma**.

In 2024, I founded **Nuuf**, my own company where I focus on **web development, software solutions, and design**.

🏃🏽 Running, 🚴🏽‍♂️ Cycling, 🏊🏻 Swimming, 🏋🏽 Strength training, 🍌🍝🍞 Fueling for all those activities and 🥑🥜🫒 Cooking delicious and healthy food for a happy gut microbiome & mind 🦠💆🏼
